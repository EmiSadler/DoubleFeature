Once you press â€˜playâ€™, a timer will begin to countdown from 30 seconds (easy mode) or 20 seconds (hard mode), and you will be presented with a random film to start.

In the given textbox, youâ€™ll need to then start typing the title of a film that links to the original. Select your film from the dropdown that appears to submit your answer.

Weâ€™ll then look to check for any links between these two films (actor, director, composer, etc.), and if successful, youâ€™ll move on to your next guess! This time, youâ€™ll need to think of a film that links to your previous guess, and so on and so forth, until the timer runs out! 

Remember though, you can only use a film once, and for each person that links a film will have a 3-strike scoring system - this means that once youâ€™ve made 3x links that include this person, youâ€™ll no longer be able to guess films that link them again.

The aim is to guess as many films you can before time runs out.

But what if I guess it wrong / time runs out?
Then itâ€™s game over! But donâ€™t worry, you can play again, and try to beat your score!
